In this section, we focus on the general concept of linear regression and explain how the linear regression model can be used from a machine learning perspective to predict a continuous numerical target variable. Furthermore, we introduce the \\(L2\\) loss in the context of linear regression and explain how its use results in an SSE-minimal model.
