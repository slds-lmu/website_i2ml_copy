title: "Chapter 15.03: Soft Margin SVM"
weight: 15003
---
Hard margin SVMs are often not applicable to practical questions because they fail when the data are not linearly separable. Moreover, for the sake of generalization, we will often accept some violations to keep the margin large enough for robust class separation. Therefore, we introduce the soft margin linear SVM.
